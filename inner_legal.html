            <h2>SUMMARY </h2><br>
            <p>In an era marked by the rapid dissemination of
                information, the prevalence of disinformation has
                emerged as a pressing social problem. To address this challenge, we aim to develop a "factbased" chatbot that serves as a reliable source
                of information. By leveraging the capabilities of
                this chatbot, we seek to counteract misinformation and empower individuals and organizations
                to make informed decisions. Our objective is to
                ensure the quality of information provided by
                chatbots, thereby offering users credible answers
                sourced from reliable sources. Moreover, we recognize the explicit interest from various market
                segments, including political candidates, civil society organizations, and academics, in harnessing
                the potential of such technology. Through this
                feasibility study, we aim to explore the viability
                of developing and implementing fact-based LLMs
                in chatbot form to address these critical needs
                and opportunities.
                findings to conclude the overall feasibility and
                potential implications.

            <h2>CHALLENGE </h2><br>
            <p>Fact-checking legal documents is crucial to ensure accuracy and reliability. Here are some steps you can follow:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Read the Entire Document: Read the entire document thoroughly to understand its purpose and context.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check Dates and Names: Verify all dates, names, addresses, and other identifying information for accuracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify Legal Citations: Check all legal citations, references, and footnotes to ensure they are accurate and up-to-date.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Review Legal Terms and Definitions: Confirm that all legal terms and definitions used in the document are correct and appropriate for the context.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cross-Check References: Verify all cross-references within the document to ensure consistency and accuracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Review Legal Authority: Verify the legal authority cited in the document, such as statutes, regulations, case law, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Confirm Formatting and Structure: Ensure that the document is formatted correctly and follows the appropriate structure for its type (e.g., contract, brief, memorandum).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check for Grammar and Spelling Errors: Review the document for any grammar, spelling, or typographical errors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consult with Subject Matter Experts: If necessary, consult with subject matter experts, such as lawyers or legal scholars, to ensure accuracy and completeness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Final Review: Conduct a final review of the document to ensure that all necessary changes have been made and that it is ready for distribution or filing.
                    </li>   
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>INNOVATION </h2><br>
            <p>The appropriate data sources for training and
                evaluating the LLM chat-bot model must prioritize quality and diversity. Well-edited books and
                literature provide structured language examples,
                while scientific papers offer accurate, specialized
                content. Reliable news outlets and educational
                materials like Wikipedia contribute to a mix of
                current affairs and factual knowledge. Despite
                variability, online forums and social media offer insights into informal language use. Government and legal documents provide authoritative
                language structures. Specialized fact-checking
                datasets such as FEVER and LIAR are crucial
                for refining fact-checking abilities.</p>
